Sardines
========

Sardines is a mobile geohunting adventure game based on the children's tag game
_sardines_. In the original children's game, one person who is _it_ would hide,
while the other participants would search for the individual. To bring this game
into the mobile-app sphere, hiding is replaced with a geotagged picture.
